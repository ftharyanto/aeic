<h4>Tectonic Earthquake Monitoring in Indonesia</h4>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Indonesia is one of the most earthquakes-prone countries of the world. Because of Indonesia is at the convergence of three active tectonic plates which are generating the earthquake. A study of historical earthquakes recorded throughout the world shows that most of the epicenters of major earthquake events are concentrated in this mobile area. Some of the destructive earthquake in Indonesia that occurred in this area, including the Aceh earthquake(2004), Nias earthquake (2005), Pangandaran earthquake (2006) and Mentawai Earthquake (2010). Not a bit of loss of life and property caused by the earthquake. Therefore, monitoring of seismic activity in Indonesia is an important part in order to reduce the risk of earthquakes.

    After the Aceh tsunami earthquake December 2004, Indonesia strengthening earthquake monitoring network to support the establishment of the tsunami early warning system in Indonesia. Reinforcement in the form of increasing the number and type of sensors used in monitoring earthquakes. Currently 162 broadband seismometers and 237 accelerometer has installed spread all over Indonesia to monitor seismic activity in the region. With this development, Indonesia is able to inform the parameters of earthquakes in less than 5 minutes after the earthquake.</p>
