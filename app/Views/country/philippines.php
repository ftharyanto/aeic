<h3 class="text-center">Earthquake and Volcano Monitoring Network in the Philippines</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Philippines is considered to be one of the most earthquakes-prone countries of the world. There are a number of earthquake generators in the country. The archipelago is bounded by oppositely-dipping subduction zones. As well as transected by a number of fault, where movement are periodically detected through the recordings of tectonic earthquakes.

    At least five imperceptible to perceptible earthquakes occurs per day. However, there are some regions of the country, which are considered more earthquake prone than others, such as east tern Mindanao, Leyte and Samara which host an average of 16 felt earthquakes per year. The most recent destructive earthquakes were the 16 august 1976 Moro gulf earthquakes (Ms=7.9), which triggered a tsunami, the 16 July 1990 Luzon earthquakes (Ms=7.8) , which was generated by movement along the northern segment of the Philippine fault zone and the 15 November 1994 Mindoro earthquakes (ms=7.1) which like wise triggered a tsunami.

    Seismological observation in the Philippines could be traced as early as 1884. but it was only after 1986 that the Philippine institute of volcano logy and seismology Come in to being , which took on the responsibility of seismic monitoring in the country.

    PHIVOLCS is currently operating and maintaining 29 manned seismic observatories, 6 volcanological observatories and 3 telemetered station. Each manned station is equipped with short period seismographs operating on a 24-hours basis. Daily transmissions of seismic data to the central office in question city are done through single side band radios or through telephone lines. The data are processed and issued as earthquake bulletin by the crisis by central office. During occurrence of destructive earthquakes, PHIVOLCS respond to the crisis by sending a quick response team. QRT, which conduct seismic monitoring of aftershock, geological investigation, impact assessment and information dissemination. Like wise PHIVOLCS also conduct public awareness program on the earthquake hazards in the Philippine and how they can be mitigated on a regular basis.

    By improving the earthquakes monitoring and prediction capability of the institute we may be able to minimize, if not totally eliminate disaster whish may arise from the occurrences of large-magnitude earthquakes in the Philippines.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Philippines archipelago is one of the world's most tectonically active areas inasmuch as it is situated along the circum-pacific belt of fire. As an offshoot of this geographic, geologic and tectonic setting, the country is highly vulnerable to such natural disaster as volcanic eruption , occurrences of destructive earthquake and other relative phenomena. A study of historical earthquakes recorded throughout the world shows that most of the epicenters of major earthquake events are concentrated in this mobile belt.

    There are two major tectonic plate movement influencing the tectonic activity in the Philippines. The north westward moving pacific plate is currently pushing the Philippine sea plate toward the eastern side of the archipelago. The rate of movement is about seven centimeter per year. On the other hand , the oceanic region of the slower moving Eurasian plate are being sub ducted along the western side of Luzon and MINDORO. At the rate of three centimeter per year. The movement of the northeastward component of the Eurasian plate is sustaining the active collision of the continental block of Palawan with MINDORO and that of the northern sections of the Zamboanga peninsula with western MINDORO.

    There are eight major and several minor earthquakes generator in the Philippines. These major tectonic structures are zones where differential movement of solid material are likely to occur and consequently generating earthquakes. The Philippines is bounded by several trenches: on the west by east dipping manila trench, Negros trench and sulu trench; on the east by west dipping Philippine trench. And on the south by east dipping Cotabato trench and west dipping Davao trench. Thus, the Philippines can be described as a wedge caught between two oppositely -dipping subduction zones. The archipelago is likewise transected by numerous faults of normal, wrench, Tran current and thrust fault types that form lineament in the Philippine landscape. Foremost among these zones of weakness is the Philippine fault zone, which extends from northern Luzon to eastern Visayas too as far south as eastern Mindanao. The distribution of earthquake occurrences in the country is greatly influenced by these tectonic process.

<h4>Seismicity in Philippines</h4>
<p>The Philippines hosts at least five imperceptible to perceptible earthquake per day
    How ever, not all parts of the country are equally vulnerable to destructive earthquakes. Based on spatial distribution of earthquake events, the most seismically active region are eastern Mindanao, Leyte , Samara with and average of 16 perceptible tremors per year. The seismic activity in these regions can be directly be attribute to movement along the Philippine trench and the Philippine fault zones.. other relatively active regions are found at the eastern sector of northern Luzon and areas in the vicinity of Lubang island and MINDORO.
    Needed to adequately cover the Philippine archipelago and be able to locate earthquakes more accurately

    The seismic station if PHIVOLCS are equipped with short period seismographs and are manned by well-trained personal on a 24-hour basis. Seismic data from each of the seismic station SRE relayed every morning to the central office in question city using single side band SSB radio transceiver or via telephone for processing, interpretation and dissemination. The filed personal are also required to report to the central office seismic data of felt events or those with magnitude 4 and above immediately after their occurrence.
    Earthquake parameter are determined with the use of computerized hypo central determination program utilizing a dapped least squared algorithm and a velocity model adapted from Jeffrey and Bullen. It required a minimum of five P- arrival data and if possible one good S-arrival.
    Accuracy of epicenter location is determined by the root mean square rms, with minimal number of iteration every 1km and less than 1.0 rms. Implying greater degree of confidence in determination. Accuracy of plotting are in the order of +/- 5-15 kms. For magnitude calculation, a quick basic program maggal2 utilizes formula developed by Uy and Punzalan.1985. for the Philippine earthquakes. The data required are time duration and distance of the epicenter to the recording stations. Results are displayed in local magnitude, surface magnitude and body magnitude. Magnitude calculations are based on data from calibrated PHIVOLCS seismograph already located in predetermined seismic stations.

    A sts1 and sts2 broad band seismic observation system is in operation at out Tagaytay and Baguio seismic station respectively. The equipment are being maintained in cooperation with DPRI, Kyoto university. Data are stored in mo-disk and are also available in analogue record.
    A program of global alliance of regional network (garnet) has been conceived by scientist at several research institution in Japan and funded by Japanese science and technology. Agency. The primary goal of garnet project is to enhance international cooperation, coordination and communication in observational seismology through a program of tele seismic waveform data exchange among regional and national seismic networks for selected earthquakes worldwide to study the earth deep structure. Hardware were provided by the project and digital record were sent to Japan for analysis and interpretation.
    At the rate , the cities are growing, and with the current government efforts to accelerate industrial development by putting up more building , road, power plant and other infrastructures, the need for a wider database becomes apparent since seismic risk is relatively greater in populated areas. Photographic strong motion accelerograph in metro manila. With the help of the USGS donated spare art, Kinematrics SMA aut of operation for a long time were repaired and calibrated. Likewise Kyoto University donated 3 analogue strong motion accelographs and where installed in Mindanao.
    For the 1998 , in cooperation with Tokyo institute of technology , 8 strong motion digital accerlograph will be operational in metro manila.
    To keep the public and authorizes informed, an earthquakes bulletin is issued for each major earthquakes, which contain all the details of events. During times of earthquakes crisis. PHIVOLCS send a quick response team QRT to conduct immediate impact assessment and install and operate temporary seismic stations to monitor aftershock in the area. PHIVOLCS likewise coordinates with various disaster management agencies such as the disaster coordinating council. Office of civil defense, Philippine national red cross, also conduct public awareness programs through periodic tours of schools and communities, giving lectures//seminar and exhibits on earthquakes hazards and safety measures before, during and after earthquakes occurrences.</p>

<h4>Future Plan</h4>
<p>Modernization of seismic instrument system is also desired with the uses of telemetred and digital instrument. A JICA project to improve the earthquakes and volcano monitoring capability of PHIVOLCS is being worked out between the Philippine and the Japanese government. Thirty three 33 sites for earthquakes and volcano monitoring station were identified for improvement by telemetered to on central recording station and three sub center. These station will de equipped the minimum required number of monitoring equipment and facilities to ensure continuous and reliable generation and collection of seismic data.
    considering the number and distribution of active earthquakes generator in the Philippine, at least sixty strategically, distributed seismic station are needed to enable PHIVOLCS to effectively and accurately document the seism city of the country. In dong so seismic hazard and risk assessment could be better addressed. Proper land use planning with due consideration of the identified seismic hazard could be minimize if not totally eliminate disasters arising from earthquakes.</p>
