<h3 class="text-center">Seismology on LAO P.D.R.</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Lao People's Democratic Republic is a landlocked country situated in the center of the indochinese peninsula with population of 4.6 million sharing border with China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. The countries covers an of 236.800 km2. Elevation ranges from 81 m amsl in the Mekong river on the southern border with Cambodia to 2.819 m in the mountain Phoubia situated 130 km NNE of Vientiane, capital city. In the high ground of northern LAO and toward the SE along the Annamite mountain ridge whose watershed defines the Lao P.D.R.-Vietnam border many summit reach elevation between 1.200 m and 2000 m. The Mekong river which defines much of the western border of LAO, flows southwards from elevation of just under 600 m amsl on the border with Myanmar to less thane 100 m a further 1970 km downstream at the border with Cambodia. Most of the remaining major river within the country flow Westward or Southwards into the Mekong rivers.

    The climate of the Lao is tropical. The general circulation over the region is dominated by two monsoons: the north-east and the south- west. The northeast affects from November to mid march, when atmospheric pressure are high. It is a dry period with low humidity and temperature. The southwest monsoon affects from mid may to mid October, short dry spell of about 2 week is normally experienced from cyclonic disturbance which are classified as depression, tropical storms or Typhoons.

<h4>Situation of earthquake disaster</h4>
<p>Lao P.D.R. is lightly affected from the impacts of earthquakes. Even the epicenter is far, it can be felt throughout the country especially in the northern provinces but the magnitude is may be not high. So the damage to building or human life is nor severe.

    Lao P.D.R. has not yet his seismological stations for earthquakes to prevention and monitoring system. In the past , no institution was responsible for this matter so in 1997 this responsibility of the seismological observation and monitoring was mentioned in the new role and function of the department of meteorology and hydrology. In this field until now, there is no station, no observation , no data and technicians or scientist on the seismology.

    In the further , one or two station should be installed in particular in northern past of Lao also the seismological training should be done and the international and regional cooperation should be set up.
