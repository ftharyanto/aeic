<h3 class="text-center">Seismic Activity and Seismological Network in Vietnam</h3>
<h4>Seismic Activity</h4>
<p>In figure 1. shown the location of Vietnam in the regional tectonic setting. The collision of Indian and Eurasian plates deformed all the east Asian continent and divided it into the sub plates moving to the different directions mainly to the east and southeast.
    We can see in this figure the red river fault as one of the boundaries of these sub plates. Beside, Vietnam is situated between two greatest dynamic belt of the planet: the Mediterranean-Himalayan and pacific ones. It is suffering strongly the influence of these belts.

    The above mentioned tectonic situation causes in the territory of Vietnam the intensive and differentiated movement divided this territory into the tectonic regions with different tectonic regime. The part of the territory from the red river fault to the north belongs the south Chinese active platform, from the Red River fault to the Tra bongs fault is the north Vietnam folded system and the part of the territory from tra bong fault to the Hau river fault belong to the Indocini massif. Beside that , from the late Mesozoic division up to now the above mentioned regions are strongly reformed and divided. The rift activity in the south east part of the Indocini massif has reformed theses of the territory into the Cenozoic basins :Hanoi basin in the north and Cuu long basin in the south respectively

    The regions were divided into some units by the deep fault. Most of main faults in Vietnam are strike-slip fault. The NW-SE deep strike-slip fault system in the north is more active than the longitudinal or NE-SW fault system.

    Relating to the tectonic characteristics. Vietnam is a country with moderate seismicity. The seismic hazard is not so height but it is also necessary to take care.
    The strong earthquake with magnitude ms>=5 from 1900 to 1995 are listed in the table 1 and epicenter of the earthquakes with magnitude Ms>4 in Vietnam of this period are shown in the epicenter map figure3.
    It is clear that Vietnam is not quiet in seismic activity and earthquakes must frequently occur in the north rather than in the south. The largest events are earthquakes of ms=6.7-6.8 occurred in the Northwest of Vietnam in Dienbien 11/1935 and Tuan Giao 24/6/1993.
    They caused destructions of building and construction in the area of thousand square kilometers. In the another regions, there were not an earthquake of magnitude larger than 5.5.
</p>

<h4>Seismological network</h4>
<p>Digital instrument , from which data can be stored electronically and easily processed ., were replacing the older analog instruments where data are stored in the form of photographic image in papers.

    At present, in Vietnam there are 14 seismic station . the fundamental parameters of the network are shown I the table 2. the figure 4 present the distribution of seismological network in Vietnam, the concentration of earthquakes in the north of Vietnam causes the most of stations are installed in it. There are 11 stations in the north and only 3 once I the south.
    Depending upon the seismic equipment Vietnam seismological network divided into 2 different observation system 1. telemetry seismic array 2. individual stations.
</p>

<h5>1. Telemetry Seismic Array</h5>
<p>This array consist 6 stations being around Hanoi, Chua Tram Bavi (Ha Tay), Doan Hung (Tuyen Quang) Bac Giang, Tam Dao and Phu lien. The principle of work of telemetry seismic array shown in fig 5. the seismic signal from receiver will be amplified and converted to the digital signal and thought generator in the filed of frequency modulated FM transmitted to the recording centre for interpretation

    The technical parameters of this array are presented as following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seismograph: Mark Product model l-4c , Eignfrequency :1 Hz, 3 components (2 station,), 1 vertical component (4 station)</li>
    <li>Transmission frequency 475 MHz</li>
    <li>Sampling rate 75 sps</li>
    <li>Acquisition equipment geotras-95 made in France with 1 set of IBM pc 586 ( hard driver:850 mb)</li>
</ul>
<p>Software ACQUI (Strasbourg institute of geophysics permit to store continuously seismic signal on hard drive automatically. The seismic event will be analyzed for locating earthquakes epicenter by using the program written by Vietnamese seismologist.
    Figure 6 shown seismic traces recorded by the telemetry seismic array and result of the analysis . it's earthquakes occurred in Muong Luan. 35 km in the east-east south east to the Dienbien at 18h39 gmt June, 30 1996 with magnitude 5.0</p>
<h5>2. Individual Stations</h5>
<p>The rest 8 station work in individual regime. In figure 4 shown the principle of work of this system. The principle of work of these stations is used digital technology , storing continuously seismic signals on hard drive and to extract seismic event on floppy disk automatically.

    The technical parameter of individual stations are presented as following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seismograph Len arts electronic, model le-3d Eignfrequency 1 Hz, 3 component</li>
    <li>Sampling rae:75 sps</li>
    <li>Acquisition equipment Geostras -95 made in France with 1 set of IBM pc 586 (hard driver 850 mb)</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of observation will be transmitted to the data processing center in Hanoi by two ways:1 quick transmission by telephone line using modem when occurred strong events and 2 sending by post the stored floppy disks every month. The software used for acquisition and interpretation is the same one which used for telemetry array. In figure 7 shown seismic traces recorded by one station of individual system.
    Finally , the Vietnam seismological network is monitoring all the seismic event of magnitude larger than 3.0 in the territory of Vietnam. And also the storing of seismic signal by digital instrument will give us a change to promote seismological observation in Vietnam and to exchange the seismic data with another countries easily and quickly , so that our participation into ASNET -RESED projects is real necessary</p>
