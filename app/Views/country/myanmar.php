<h3 class="text-center">Seismologycal Monitoring System Of Myanmar<h3>
        <h4>Myanmar</h4>
        <p>Myanmar covers an area of 678,528 km2. The country lies between about 10oN and 28o30 'N and 92o 30'E and 101o 30' E. The greatest north-south extent is about 2,200 km and the greatest east-west extent about 950 km. In the 800 km long part of southern Myanmar, the Taninthayi area, the east west extent is only 50 to 150 km.

            In the west, the Union of Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh, in the north-west by India, in the north and north-east by the Peoples' Republic of China, in the east by Laos and in the south east by Thailand. The total length of the country's border is 4,000 km. The central and southern part of the country is bounded in the west by the 2,100 km long Rakhine and Taninthayi coastline of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.

            Myanmar is the homeland of the great number of different ethnic and linguistic groups. The Union of Myanmar includes 7 federal states, namely Kayin, Mon, Kayah, Rakhine, Chin, Shan and Kachin, and 7 divisions, namely Yangon, bago, Mandalay, Sagaing, Ayeyarwady, Taninthayi, and Magway. The locations of the state and divisions are shown in Figure 1.
        </p>

        <h4>Geological Aspect</h4>
        <p>Myanmar is part of the extra-peninsular region, which also comprises the young fold mountains of the Himalayan and hill ranges of Afghanistan and Baluchistan in the west. All this area forms part of a weak and flexible zone of the earth's crust which has not yet attains its final state of equilibrium. That those folding movements have not yet ceased is proved by the frequent occurrence of earthquakes. Indeed, minor quakes are felt not infrequently in Yangon, the capital city of Myanmar. These may be associated with the most continuous folding of the ridge on the southern end of which stand the Shwedagon pagoda, golden gigantic religious edifice of Buddhism.

            Volcanoes tend to act as safety values and to relieve the strain and pressure; it is to be noted that a number of extinct volcanoes, Mount Popa which situates in the central part of the country is the tourist's attraction for its scenic beauty and a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.
        </p>

        <h4>Seismicity</h4>
        <p>As Myanmar is situated on the boundary of Alpide-Himalayan Earthquake belt where devastating earthquakes had occurred from time to time, there is obviously the seismic risk in and near the country. The earthquakes in this Alpide-Himalayan region have resulted in massive loss of life and untold suffering. The Alpide-Himalayan zone, extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Andaman Sea, is characterized by a widely diffused continental region encompassing young mountain ranges. These mountains owe their existence to large compressive forces resulting from collision of Indian plate and Eurasia Plate and are mostly associated with shallow earthquakes.

            A geological collision between Indian sub continental plate and the rest of Eurasia Continental plate on which Myanmar stands and the collision is still in progress. The world highest mountains, Himalayas rise abruptly from the flat, densely populate Ganges Plain in the northern India and shield the Tibatan plateau from the seasonally shifting monsoon winds of southern Asia.

            As an example of its currents effects of collision, we believed the great earthquake that occurred in the region was the result of forces originated in the collision area. Even in Myanmar, the moderate seismically active country, the Bago earthquake of 5 May 1980 caused the loss of about 500 lives at Bago and 50 lives at Yangon with major destruction at Bago and some destruction at Yangon. The Sagaing earthquake of 16 July 1956 caused damages to religious edifices and buildings at Sagaing and about 40 lives were lost. The Pagan earthquake of 8 July 1975 caused destruction too many historical monuments at Pagan Pagan earthquake of July 1975 caused destruction to many historical monuments at Pagan and 2 lives were lost. It was really the untold religious heritage losses to its people. The Tagaung earthquake of 5 January 1991 caused moderate destruction to the surrounding area. A list of some of the strong earthquakes that occurred in Myanmar is given in Table 1.</p>

        <h4>Structural Feature</h4>
        <p>Due to the collision of the continental and oceanic plates, the country falls naturally into the following four divisions, each of which runs from north to south, through the length of the land.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Shan Plateau in the east.</li>
            <li>The central belt of Myanmar, covering roughly the basins of the lower Ayeyerwady and its tributary, the Chindwinn, and the basin of the Sittoung River.</li>
            <li>The fold ranges of the Rakhine Yomas, the Naga and Maniour Hills.</li>
            <li>The narrow coastal strip of Rakhine</li>
        </ol>

            <h4>DMH</h4>
            <p>The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) is a state organization under the Ministry of Communications, Post and Telegraph of the Government of the Union of Myanmar responsible for undertaking measurements, data management, computations, studies and provisions of services on all aspects of meteorology, hydrology, seismology and agro meteorology to meet the requirements of the nation and its people.
            </p>
            <h4>Seismological Division</h4>
            <p>A full-fledge seismological division was establish in 1986 under the control and management of the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology in accordance with the UNESCO / UNDP Regional project RAS/79/116: Regional Seismological Network of Himalayan Range which unfortunately failed to come up to its implementation stage. Nowadays, the department has four seismological stations and the seismological division is manned by twenty-five staff including three officered.
                The recording of earthquakes, analysis, processing and compilation of seismic data were systematically carried by the division. Seismicity of different regions in the country have also been studied and prepared. All major construction groups in the country had now sought for earthquake information at their construction sites for the purposes of taking earthquake resistant measures. Seismic data for that purposes are also provided and supplied by the department.
            </p>
            <h4>Network</h4>
            <p>The threat of earthquake in Myanmar ha been long recognized by the government and its people and efforts, therefore, were being made to establish a seismological network to deal with all works pertaining to seismicity ever since the early sixties. Earthquake recording was undertaken at Yangon as early as 1962 and at Mandalay in 1966, using only then the electromagnetic seismographs with photographic recordings.

                In September 1970, a moderate earthquake with its epicenter near Yangon, there were many buildings suffered cracks and minor damage. A team of Japanese seismological experts was invited by the government to find out what could be done with the threat of earthquakes in Myanmar. The team, in addition to its recommendation for seismic resistant measures in construction and the formulation of earthquake resistant regulations, also recommended the seismological network consisting of 8 stations to provide a full coverage of earthquakes in and near Myanmar, whenever only earthquakes of 5.0 and above on Richter scale occurred. Those stations should be located at Yangon, Mandalay, Sittway, Dawei, Myitkyina, Kalemyo, Magway and Taunggyi.

                Another moderate earthquake jolted central Myanmar in 1975 with its epicenter near Pagan - Nyaung Oo and produced slight to moderate damages to many religious edifices and brick buildings. This Pagan earthquake had awakened the country to the fact that earthquake threat to the country is very dangerous to its people and properties. In 1976, two sets of Japanese visual velocity type seismograph were purchased and each set was installed at Yangon and Mandalay in 1977. In 1984, two sets of solar powered visual velocity type seismograph were obtained through the assistance was installed at Sittway in 1984 and another was installed at Dawei in 1985.

                A digitized seismograph, manufactured in USA was obtained though the assistance of the regional UNESCO office in New Delhi, India in 1995. The relevant software and training on interpretation of seismic are being request to the UNESCO.
            </p>
            <h4>Monitoring</h4>
            <p>There are only four seismological stations for monitoring earthquakes in and near the country. Out of four stations, three stations at Mandalay, Dawei and Sittway are equipped with Japanese Katsujima short-period seismographs. Only in Yangon, capital city of Myanmar, one Japanese Katsujima short-period seismograph, one Japanese Katsujima long-period seismograph and one US K2 Digitized Seismograph, altogether three seismograph are installed. Locations of the existing and planned seismological stations are shown in Figure 2.

                Whenever an earthquake occurred in the country, seismic data were collected from the out-stations simultaneously by using telephones, single side band (S.S.B) etc. Then the locations of epicenter with body wave magnitude and origin time was analyzed and determined at Yangon, main seismological office. After thoroughly analyzing the seismic data, earthquake information was disseminated to the people and the users through radio, television and news papers.

                Since our network is not completed yet, in case of emergency to locate the epicenters of earthquake which had occurred in the country, we have to make, sometimes, request the neighboring ASEAN countries for the earthquake information by using fax.

                Altough our Japanese analog seismographs are old and still in urgent need of calibration, repair and replacement, the seismological division is doing its best to run all the existing stations smoothly and to provide the country with seismological data for national projects and construction work.

                As engineers require modern design technology and basic seismic information, preferably for long period, to construct earthquake resistant buildings and infrastructure, seismic zoning of the country for designing is necessary for safety and efficiency. For this purpose, the department provide the seismicity index map which will in some way serve as zoning map for earthquake risk. The seismicity index map is illustrated in Figure 3.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Myanmar tries its best to upgrade the monitoring system with the intention to lessen and mitigate the disastrous effects of earthquakes. It is envisaged that when the complete seismological network recommended by the Japanese seismological experts could be established and well-equipped with modernized instrument, disasters due to earthquakes in this part of the world could be thoroughly understood and more efficient steps be taken to combat against their disastrous effects.
