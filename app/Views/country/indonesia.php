<h3 class="text-center">Tectonic Earthquake Monitoring in Indonesia</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Indonesia is one of the most earthquakes-prone countries of the world. Because of Indonesia is at the convergence of three active tectonic plates which are generating the earthquake. A study of historical earthquakes recorded throughout the world shows that most of the epicenters of major earthquake events are concentrated in this mobile area. Some of the destructive earthquake in Indonesia that occurred in this area, including the Aceh earthquake(2004), Nias earthquake (2005), Pangandaran earthquake (2006) and Mentawai Earthquake (2010). Not a bit of loss of life and property caused by the earthquake. Therefore, monitoring of seismic activity in Indonesia is an important part in order to reduce the risk of earthquakes.

    After the Aceh tsunami earthquake December 2004, Indonesia strengthening earthquake monitoring network to support the establishment of the tsunami early warning system in Indonesia. Reinforcement in the form of increasing the number and type of sensors used in monitoring earthquakes. Currently 162 broadband seismometers and 237 accelerometer has installed spread all over Indonesia to monitor seismic activity in the region. With this development, Indonesia is able to inform the parameters of earthquakes in less than 5 minutes after the earthquake.</p>

<h4>Tectonic Setting and Seismicity of Indonesia</h4>
<p>Indonesia lies on the boundaries of three tectonic plates, which slide past each other. These three tectonic plates are: The continental-oceanic Indo-Australian Plate to the south, the oceanic Pacific Plate to the east, the Eurasian Plate to the north(where most of Indonesia area lies), and the Philippine Plate. The Indo-Australian Plate moves north, colliding the Eurasian Plate. The Pacific Plate moves west, whereas the Eurasian Plate in relation to the other plate is not moving.

    The relative movement between these four tectonic plates causes an accumulation of pressure and mechanical stress where they collide. When the material’s elasticity is no longer able to withstand this stress, the rock will break and spring back to something close to its original shape. This rebound, which generates strong seismic waves that radiate in all directions along the tectonic plate, is called a tectonic earthquake.

    Millions of these earthquakes have occurred over thousands and millions of years on the geological time scale. Evidence of these past earthquakes is recorded in natural geological phenomena (paleo-seismology). Today earthquake can be recorded using seismometer networks, which calculate an earthquake location and focal depth (hypocenter) and measure its magnitude. Approximately 4000 earthquakes happened in Indonesia per year, whereas earthquake of magnitude greater than 5.5, or earthquake that can be physically felt on land, average around 70 – 100 per years, and destructive earthquakes around one to two times a year. Between 1991 – 2011, 186 significant earthquakes were recorded in Indonesia seismic network.</p>

<h4>Indonesian Seismic Network</h4>
<p>Post the Aceh earthquake December 26, 2004, the government of Indonesia, decided to develop a network of digital seismic for the monitoring of regional seismic station for monitoring of regional seismicity and to collect data for tsunami early warning system. In order to monitor seismic activity in Indonesia and surrounding areas, Indonesia has developed an earthquake monitoring network consisting of Broadband Seismometers and Accelerometers spread in the region of Indonesia. By using these new seismic networks and new seismic data analysis, Seiscomp3, Indonesia has been able to provide earthquake information to the interface institution and public less than 5 minutes after the earthquake occurred.</p>

<p>Indonesia is currently operating and maintaining 162 broadband seismometers and 237 accelerometers. Some of the accelerometer placed collocated with broadband seismometers location. Using telemetry equipment and VSat lines, these digital recordings are transmitted on real-time mode to the central processing system at BMKG. The data are processed and issued as earthquake bulletin or tsunami warning by the central office.</p>
