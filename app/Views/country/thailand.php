<h1 class="text-center">Seismic Monitoring Network in Thailand</h1>
<p class="text-center">Burin WECHBUNTHUNG</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Generally in the past it has been believed that Thailand locates in low seismicity area, no earthquake effect to the people. Severe seismic intensity caused by major earthquake have never occurred inside Thai territory areas except one events in history was recording that describing the collapse of a town in the northern part by a big earthquake more than thousand years ago. By the time passed, many important events that panicked to people have been forgotten. However, in the past 3 decades several moderate earthquakes occurred more frequently and caused a great panic to the public with slight to moderate damages to the vulnerable development, create enormous construction with crowded community are expanded into seismic risk zones. Some locations of moderate earthquakes that have never harmed to people in the past record initially cause some damage to vulnerable construction.

    Several agencies concerned establish their own seismic network or improve their instruments to monitor these phenomena on the purpose of obtaining the basic information of location, occurring time and magnitude which are necessary for Thai scientist and engineers to study the nature of earthquakes.

    Looking back into the historic records of seismicity in neighboring countries such a Burma, China, Andaman Sea, earthquakes of magnitude greater than 7 Richter and some potentially seismic sources of long faults in the northern and western part, cause the worrying of dangerous situation that may be occur in the future to Thai scientist and engineers. To realized this problem, several efforts have been done in the past decades, installing analog seismic monitoring system, established National Earthquake committee of Thailand, extends seismic section in Meteorological Department to Division level i.e. Office of Seismology, cooperated with experts from China, USA, Japan etc. Thus, at present new digital seismic monitoring are installed in order to operate, analyze, determine, and compile seismic information automatically in real time or near real time. Moreover seismic activities for prevention and mitigation will be directly implemented by several agencies related.</p>

<h2>2. Seismicity</h2>
<h3>2.1. Seismic Source Zones</h3>
<p>The most interested area for consideration is in the area of latitude 5-26 N and longitude 90-110 E which can be characterized into 12 seismic source zones A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H , I, J, K and L based on active fault zones and historical records as shown in Figure 1. Tables 1. Gives the zone names, number of events, and maximum magnitude in each zone.

    From the seismicity map of the world, Thailand is located at the eastern part of the Alpine-Himalayan earthquake belt, where the Indo-Australian plate moves and pushes northeastward to Eurasian plate. The pressure from the movement of the plates is the main causes of earthquakes along the belt.

    Basically fault system in Thailand can be grouped into 3 different categories (1) N-S normal fault (2) NW-SE strike slip fault (3) NE-SW strike slip fault. Shrestha(1) identified 9 active fault zones as shown in Figure 2 and some description are the following.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Chaingrai Fault. This fault trends east-northeasterly and its approximately 130 km, long. The largest earthquake recorded along this fault is magnitude 4.9 Mb on September 1, 1978. Earthquake of smaller magnitude were frequent, three of these are above 4.5 Mb. The maximum focal depth is 10 km.</li>
    <li>Mae Tha Fault. The arc shaped concave toward Chiangmai. It is about 100 km, long. The fault plane dips 50-55 degree toward northwest. A cluster of shallow depth small earthquake occurs in northwestern part of Mae Tha Fault.</li>
    <li>Phrae Fault. This fault bounds the eastern rim of Phrae basin. Its length is about 115 km. During the past 10 years, more than 20 earthquakes of magnitude 3-4 occurred along this fault.</li>
    <li>Thoen fault. This fault is roughly parallel to Pharae fault. Its length is about 100 km. A few earthquakes of low magnitude were recorded along the fault. The latest one was recorded on December 23, 1980 with magnitude 3.7.</li>
    <li>Moei Uthai Thani fault. The northwestern trending Moei Utahi Thani Fault is one of the major fault systems in Thailand. The fault is about 250 km, long. Several splay faults were mapped branching off from this fault. An earthquake of magnitude 5.6 occurred on February 17, 1975. A focal plane solution shows a component of right lateral movement.</li>
    <li>Sri Sawat Fault. This fault lies to the west of Moei Uthai Thani Fault with the most parallel trend. It occupies the Quae Yai and Mae Klong River channels and extends northwesterly into Burma. The total is more than 500 km. Several earthquakes were reported along this fault, the largest of which occurred on April 22, 1983 with magnitude 5.9 on Richter scale. All earthquakes are of shallow depths. Ground crack and landslides were reported in the epicenter area. The focal plane solution of the April 22, 1983 earthquakes shows a right lateral strike slip along this fault.</li>
    <li>Three Pagoda Fault. This fault lies in the channel of Quae Noi River; its northwestern extension joins the Sagiang Fault of Burma. Its length in Thai portion is more than 250 km. Two large earthquakes of magnitude 7.6 and 5.8 occurred along this fault on January 7, 1937 and January 11, 1960. Several hundreds of small earthquakes have been registered since 1984.</li>
    <li>Ranong Fault. The ranong fault lies in the channel of Kra Buri River; its total length is about 270 km. One earthquake of magnitude 5.6 occurred along this fault on September 30, 1978.</li>
    <li>Klong Marui Fault. This fault cut across the Phangnga Bay and the Ban Don Bay. It is about 150 km, long. A few earthquakes were recorded in Phangnga Province and south of Phuket Province</li>
</ol>

<h3>2.2. Historical Earthquakes</h3>
<p>Historical earthquakes were scattering along the seismic source zone of faulting system. There were 2 kinds of earthquakes that effected to people in Thai territory. Firstly, earthquakes locate outside country in neighboring areas such as Burma, China, Laos, Vietnam, and Andaman Sea. Secondly, earthquakes locate inside country nearby active faults mainly in northern and western part. Most of historical earthquake records in Thailand and adjacent area were mainly compiled from 624 B.C. to 1989 by Nutalaya and Prachaub (SEASEE project). These seismic data reports contain two catalogs. First are the historical data compiled from historical text, annual, stone inscription and astrological documents. Second is the instrumental data recorded from 1900-present compiled from various sources such as USGS, ISC and Meteorological Department. The seismicity map of Thailand and adjacent area from 624 B.C. and 1983-1989 are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.
    Normally minor to moderate earthquakes could be found in northern part and western part, but in southern, northeastern, eastern part are rare.</p>

<h3>2.3. Recent Seismicity</h3>
<p>After the first installing of Chiangmai station in the year 1963, epicenter information is continuously compiled by Office of Seismology, coincident with establishment of new analog seismic monitoring instrument and then existing analog network extended until 1995. The firs exciting earthquake was on February 17, 1975 of magnitude 5.6 in northwestern Thailand. This event frightened people almost thought country. The second was earthquake occurring along Sri-Sawat Fault zone on 22 April 1983, are believed that caused by the reservoir induced seismicity, causing the maximum magnitude of 5.9 ever recorded by Meteorological Department seismographs. The wide spread panic ran throughout country and slight damages to the vulnerable buildings including created long ground crack on surface and landslides near epicenter vicinity. Other important event was an earthquake of magnitude 5.1 occurred at Pan District, Chiangrai Province northern Thailand on September 11, 1994 caused moderate damages to one of hospital building at Pan District 20-25 km. Away from epicenter, schools and temples nearby. The other two panic events were reported of earthquakes at Phrae Province on December 9, 1995 of magnitude 5.1 and earthquake at Chiangmai on December 21, 1995 of Magnitude 5.2. Both events caused slightly damages to Schools buildings and ancient pagodas as shown in Figure 5.</p>

<h2>3. Seismic Network in Thailand</h2>
<p>There are 3 agencies that operate and monitor the earthquakes, Thai Meteorological Department, Hydrographic Department and Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.
